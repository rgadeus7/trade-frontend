Next Steps for Enhancement:
Now that we have all the key levels being captured, here are some potential enhancements we could implement:
Confluence Detection: Identify when multiple indicators point to the same price level
Strength Scoring: Weight levels based on multiple confirmations
Trend Context: Consider the overall trend when classifying levels
Volume Confirmation: Add volume analysis to validate key levels
Historical Testing: Show how often levels have been tested in the past
Risk/Reward Analysis: Calculate potential risk-reward ratios for each level
The foundation is now in place to build more sophisticated level analysis and trading logic on top of this comprehensive key levels system!
